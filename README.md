# Calculator Projects

This repository contains two calculator projects:
1. **Basic Calculator**: A simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations.
2. **Scientific Calculator**: An advanced calculator with scientific functions like square root, exponents, trigonometric functions, and more.

Both projects are built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** and are designed to be interactive and responsive.

## **1. Basic Calculator**

### **Features**
1. **Basic Arithmetic Operations**:
   - Addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
2. **Clear and Delete Functions**:
   - `C` clears the entire input.
   - `DEL` deletes the last character.
3. **Decimal Support**:
   - Supports decimal numbers (e.g., `3.14`).
4. **Interactive UI**:
   - Buttons have hover and click animations.
5. **Responsive Design**:
   - Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

---

### **How to Use**
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Use the buttons to perform calculations.
3. Click `=` to see the result.
4. Use `C` to clear the display or `DEL` to delete the last character.

---

### **Files**
- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the basic calculator.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling and animations.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file for dynamic functionality.

## **2. Scientific Calculator**

### **Features**
1. **Basic Arithmetic Operations**:
   - Addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
2. **Advanced Scientific Functions**:
   - Square root (`√`), power (`x^y`), factorial (`!`).
   - Trigonometric functions: sine (`sin`), cosine (`cos`), tangent (`tan`).
   - Logarithmic functions: log (`log`), natural log (`ln`).
   - Pi (`π`) constant.
3. **History Display**:
   - Toggle the history button to view previous calculations.
4. **Interactive Design**:
   - Buttons with hover and click animations.
5. **Responsive Layout**:
   - Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

### **How to Use**
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Use the buttons to perform calculations.
3. Click `=` to see the result.
4. Use the **History** button to toggle the history display.

### **Files**
- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the scientific calculator.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling and animations.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file for dynamic functionality.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the calculator.
- **CSS**: Handles styling, animations, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the logic for calculations and interactivity.
